Tao Yang is a NYC based comedian. Tao performs all over New York at different comedy theaters and bars that aren't doing that well financially so they need a comedy night to stave off complete bankruptcy. Tao also writes and performs with a video sketch group [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4V59RT5wghBy19biAy5kFw/featured) that airs on public access television in Brooklyn and Manhattan so he is technically a TV-star. He can be seen performing with his improv group [Thunderbox](http://thunderbox.improvteams.com/) across the entire eastern seaboard.
