      <description>Hi! My name is Tao (pronounced tay-oh   ). I&amp;rsquo;m a Chinese-American comedian currently living in Los Angeles. I&amp;rsquo;m also currently a CollegeHumor cast member where I both write and perform video sketches online.
Prior to L.A., I was a writer on a house sketch team (aka Maude Night) at the Upright Citizen&amp;rsquo;s Brigade in NYC. And prior to that I was a writer on a sketch team at Boogiemanja.</description>
